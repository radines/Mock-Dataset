## Step 6 Questions

*1. What Licensing Agreement did you choose and why?*

I chose a public domain licensing agreement because the dataset that I have posted does not contain any copyrighted material and is therefore free of restrictions and is available for public use. Given that the dataset provided is randomly generated on a data creation simulator, the information included should be available for public access.
 
*2. What data archiving options are recommended by the Montana State University Library?*

The MSU library recomments using trusted and popular data repositories for publishing data. The library website provides a list of recommended data repositories including
 
*3. How would using GitHub help make your data/code align with FAIR Protocols?*

FIAR protocols are aimed to make datasets findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. Using GitHub makes a published dataset accessible to anyone in the public who choses to search for it. The features of GitHub allows users to create a detailed repository with metadata that provides all of the necessary information to the public in order to make the dataset reusable and interoperable. 

*4. What are the advantages of making your data/code more widely accessible?*

Data and code that is made available to the public can be reused and built upon. Publicly available data and code can be used to further other scientific endeavors by providing the tools necissary for other to progress farther in that field. Widely accessible code would provide the means for better scientific communication and would help the spread of ideas and knowledge. 

*5. What are the disadvantages of making your data/code more widely accessible?*

If the qualifications of an open access source are unclear, there is the possibility for individuals to publish any data or code that they want. Misleading or incorrect data or code could potentially cause problems for another researcher who is trying to incorperate it into their own project. This could lead to a spread of misinformation if the data originated from a questionable or non-peer reviewed source. 

*6. What data/code from your grad project would you envision publishing on GitHub?*

Some of the geospatial aspects of my grad project could likely be published on GitHub. By publishing a large dataset with land cover classifications, this material would be a valuable resorce to others. 

*7. What data/code would you not publish? Why?*

Some of the data from my grad project would not be published yet on GitHub because the data is owned by the Forest Service, therefore it is not in my jurisdiction to decide to publish the data and make it publicly available.
