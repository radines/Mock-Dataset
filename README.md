# Mock-Dataset

**Purpose**

The purpose of this repository is to facilitate practice in creating a repository, uploading a dataset, and providing the necessary information to the public. Having the knowledge of creating a repository for new data will enable future projects and associated datasets to be a reusable and meaningful addition to the scientific community. 

## Mock-Dataset Potential

**R Programing and Statistical Analysis**


Future repositories will have the capabilities to include R programming to assist others in recreating the statistical analysis used in a published research paper. This could include raw code or other tools to provide important information that is needed to recreate and learn from previously used data. 


**Geospatial Analysis**

Repositories such as this Mock-Dataset have the potential to provide the scientific community with programs and applications with the ability to map landcover, including wetland vegetation and land cover changes. 

## Instructions and Information

Repositories such as this may also include information on how to run created code and programs associated with a project or publication.
